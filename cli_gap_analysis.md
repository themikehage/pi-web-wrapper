# Pi CLI vs Pi Web Wrapper - Gap Analysis Report

This report analyzes the functional gaps between the native **Pi CLI** and the **Pi Web Wrapper** web application, prioritizing the features that would bring the web UI closer to the terminal experience.

---

## 1. Feature Comparison Matrix

| Feature | Pi CLI Capability | Web Wrapper Current State | Gap / Implementation Path |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Session Branching** | Native tree routing (`/tree` TUI selector, branching message nodes). | **Implemented** (Paginated bubble versions with `< 1 / 2 >` controls). | None. Feature successfully implemented in client and Hono routes. |
| **Context Compaction** | Automatic on threshold and manual via `/compact`. | Backend auto-compacts, but no UI controls or context window usage indicators. | **Missing.** Add a context window usage progress bar in the chat footer and a manual "Compact Context" button. |
| **Message Queueing** | Enqueueing steering messages (Enter) and follow-ups (Alt+Enter) during streaming. | Input area is disabled or ignored during active generation. | **Missing.** Keep the text input enabled during streaming. Route submissions to WebSocket events `steer` and `follow_up` (backend already supports these). |
| **Tool Customization** | Command line flags `--tools`, `--exclude-tools`, and `--no-builtin-tools`. | Server initializes the SDK session with default tools. No user control. | **Missing.** Implement a "Session Settings" panel where users can toggle tools (e.g., disable `bash` for safety, or run in Read-Only mode). |
| **Local Shell Commands** | Direct execution via `!command` (send output to LLM) and `!!command` (run locally). | No direct command execution capability for the user in the UI. | **Missing.** Intercept prompts starting with `!` in the input, run them on the host, and render command console blocks in the chat feed. |
| **Prompts & Skills** | Auto-discovery and expansion of prompt templates (`/name`) and Skills. | Supported by SDK under the hood, but no discovery or management UI. | **Missing.** Add a "Library" sidebar containing local project skills (from `.agents/skills`) and custom templates for quick copy/expansion. |
| **Exporting & Sharing** | `/export` (HTML/JSONL output) and `/share` (secret GitHub Gist export). | No exporting capabilities from the web UI. | **Missing.** Add a "Download Session" action (HTML / JSONL) and a "Share to Gist" action using GitHub integration. |

## 2. Priority Backlog for the Web Wrapper

### Priority 1: Message Queueing (Steering & Follow-ups)
*   **Why:** Enables the user to correct or steer the agent without waiting for complex tool runs to finish, representing a critical productivity feature in the CLI.
*   **How:** Keep the chat input active during streaming. If `streaming === true`, enter key sends a WebSocket event `{ type: "steer", message }`, and Alt+Enter (or a dropdown selector) sends `{ type: "follow_up", message }`.

### Priority 2: Agent Tools Selector & Sandboxing
*   **Why:** Secures host execution and customizes agent capabilities. Users should be able to restrict the agent to "Read-Only" mode (disabling `write`, `edit`, `bash`) before running a review.
*   **How:** Expose checkboxes in the sidebar or model selector dropdown to let users choose allowed tools. Call `session.setActiveToolsByName()` in the backend before starting a run.

### Priority 3: Context Usage Meter & Manual Compaction
*   **Why:** Provides transparency regarding the model's token consumption and cost before auto-compaction is triggered.
*   **How:** Utilize the existing token stats returned by `/api/sessions/:id/messages` to draw a progress bar (e.g., `85% of 200k context`). Add a button to manually invoke the backend's `/api/sessions/:id/compact` endpoint.

### Priority 4: Quick Prompt Templates & Skills Explorer
*   **Why:** Saves developers time by letting them load predefined templates directly in the web editor.
*   **How:** Fetch local skills and prompts in the backend, expose them via a `/api/resources` endpoint, and build an overlay in the frontend to search and inject them into the text area.
